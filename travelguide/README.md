-- Crummy documentation:
-- Use /tgs and /tgg to send commands
-- If you use a shortname, it will function identically to /travelto and take you/your group there
-- If you do not, it will fuzzy find all zones matching your argument, then show you a list of possible
-- zones you could be searching for.  Choose the number matching the zone you want, and off you go.
-- Designed to alleviate the need to remember every zone's shortname for /travelto
-- If you're still using EQBCS, manually change `local useDanNet = true` to `local useDanNet = false`
